	  <para>
	    Searches a given string for a pattern match
	    specified by a regular expression <literal>PATTERN</literal>
	    and returns a node-set consisting of
	    <literal>&lt;xsh:string&gt;</literal>
	    elements containing portions of the string matched
	    by the pattern subexpressions enclosed in parentheses.
	    The OPTIONS string may contain the following flags:
	    <literal>c</literal> - do not reset search position on a failed match when /g is in effect;
	    <literal>g</literal> - match globally, i.e. find all occurrences;
	    <literal>i</literal> - do case insensitive search;
	    <literal>m</literal> - treat string as multiple lines 
	    (change "^" and "$" from matching the start or end of the string to matching the start or end
	    of any line anywhere within the string)
	    <literal>o</literal> - compile pattern only once;
	    <literal>s</literal> - treat string as single line (change "." to match any character whatsoever, even a newline, which normally it would not match);
	    <literal>x</literal> - extend your pattern's legibility by permitting whitespace and comments.
