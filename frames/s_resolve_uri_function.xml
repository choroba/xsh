	    This function takes one or two arguments: a relative URI and an optional base URI.
	    If the first argument is a relative URI reference, 
	    this function resolves it against either the 
	    given base URI, if given (which is assumed to be an absolute URI)
	    or, if base URI not given, against the URI of the current working directory.
	    If the first argument is an absolute URI reference, it is returned unchanged. 
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    If the first argument is the zero-length string, returns 
	    the base URI if given and the URI of the current working directory otherwise.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Note: Resolving a URI does not dereference it (download
	    the referenced content); it is merely a syntactic
	    operation on two character strings.
