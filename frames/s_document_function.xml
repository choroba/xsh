	  <para>
	    Looks up among the currently open document the one whose
	    filename is same as the given URL and returns the
	    corresponding document node.  If no document's filename
	    matches exactly the given URL, then several heuristic
	    matches are tried: if the URI is a relative filename, it
	    is tilde-expanded and resolved (using the current working
	    directory as a base) and the lookup is restarted with the
	    absolute filename; finally, a lookup identifying filenames
	    with URLs of the file:// protocol is attempted.  If the
	    lookup fails completely, an empty node set is returned.
