	  <para>Returns base URI of the first node in the node-set (or
	  the current node).  The function should work on both XML and
	  HTML documents even if base mechanisms for these are
	  completely different. It returns the base as defined in RFC
	  2396 sections "5.1.1. Base URI within Document Content" and
	  "5.1.2. Base URI from the Encapsulating Entity". However it
	  does not return the document base (5.1.3), use
	  document-uri() for this.
