TODO:

### Ideas comming from e-mail discusion with Hoylen Sue

* get rid of the XSH subdirectory in the CVS tree
* 'help commands'?
* consider making perl{} blocks a type of an expression

###

* document installation proces in ActiveState perl
* check adding fragments into /
* adding into/appending/prepending /
* document new location argument-type semantics
* support DTD modification
* better support for namespaces (e.g. registering as soon as it's available
  in XML::LibXML(::XPath?)
* 'locate' - allow use also nearest id() 
* xsh-grammar: parse xslt parameters as XPATH instead of XSH expressions ??

USER-LEVEL IMPLEMENTABLE

- untag/split element                //(on user-level easy with def)
- comment-out node (?? uncomment ??) //(on user-level easy with def)


IMPLEMENTED BUT SOME MORE REFINEMENT IS NEEDED:

o fold/unfold command (fold/unfold elements for subsequent ls commands)


IMPLEMENTED:
+ port to XML::LibXML-1.53
+ unify open,open_HTML,open_PIPE,open_DOCBOOK to 
  open [XML|HTML|DOCBOOK] =[|] file|command
+ allow entity reference insertion
+ allow parameters for user defined functions
+ external xinclude save support
+ die in perl fragments dies the execution
+ better Ctrl+C handling
