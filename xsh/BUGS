KNOWN BUGS

- after open --format html the filename/url is unknown-xxx

- TODO: namespaces --registered (list registered namespace prefixes
instead of those in scope of a current node)

- TODO: close command doesn't remove document references neither from
  lexical variables nor global variables whose content has been
  temporarily replaced by localization

- it is not possible to perform XPath searches on namespace
  nodes (it's a limitation of libxml2)


- possibly 

  undefined namespace prefix `table' at /home/pajas/Documents/normalize_addresses.xsh line 41, column 97, offset 1160.

- namespaces .
utf-8/:

- --skip-xmldecl doesn't work for toFile and toFH so we need a
workaround. The problem here is compression.

- command redirection fails (no output) if the script is passed to
xsh2 as STDIN and encoding is applied (either via $ENCODING variable
or the encoding command).

- the following seems to be parsed incorectly (from www/cielbleu/make.xsh2):

 if (@lang) { $lang = @lang } else { $lang = $language_prefix }

(adding semicolons to each of the blocks does help)
